<h2>WELCOME TO THE LITRACY WORLD.</h2>  
<p>India treasured a great system of legal chronologies since Vedic period. Societal practices to
modern codified laws to adhering to international principles, the Indian legal system come
out as a most emerging episode in the world today. However, there is duskiness opposed to
this bright part – that refers to the unfamiliarity of the legal privileges available to the
common people. It is not that only illiterates but many literate masses come under this part of
darkness. Hence, organising time to time camp or training on legal literacy is the most welcoming step for the society at large.
</p>
<p>
Legal literacy assumes part of basic education of individuals with the rapid changing of
society and system of administration. To impart legal literacy is the social liability of students
pursuing law degree or non-governmental organisation, social welfare committees under the
government, district or legal service authority. Literacy can be communicated to the people
through various modes, like, organising seminar, workshop, camp, training sessions, etc. by
the legal professionals or experts. Very often, legal literacy camps are proved to be very
effective among common people as it is a great help to reach to the poor and underdeveloped.
Hence, legal literacy can be a very effective and influential means to inculcate qualitative
knowledge amid people and make them mindful about their rights and privileges.
</p>  
<p>
Legal literacy means to educate people about their legal rights and entitlements. Basically,
legal literacy works as a precondition amongst people to live in dignity. To assure a dignified
life with the skill of legal knowledge – is the moto of legal literacy. The famous philosopher
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn quotes,
“Justice is conscience, not a personal conscience but the conscience of the whole of
humanity. Those who clearly recognise the voice of their own conscience usually recognise
also the voice of justice”.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, legal literacy draws immense importance as it is technique to make attentive
towards privileges of being human. To get justice in true sense, one must have basic legal
knowledge and legal literacy serves this purpose. Literacy may be dispersed through
camping, training, educating, so on and so forth.
