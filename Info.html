<h2>THE NEED FOR LEGAL LITERACY.</h2>  
<p>The statistics of the National Human Rights Commission reveals that in the year 2019, only
6476 cases are registered in it under different categories of human rights violations in India.
But the real number might be much more than the figure of the statistics. Despite having laws
on domestic violation, incidences of domestic violence and bride burning cases are going at
the same pace. Eve-teasing incidences are part of daily life in every knock and corner of
many states in India even today. Moreover, increasing incidences of acid attack mostly for
taking revenge added in enlarging the list of offences.
</p>
<p>
In India, at least one woman faced sexual harassment in every one and half minute and one
child is abused in every three seconds. Kidnapping of minor girls and luring children from
economically weak families of remote areas specially border areas for human trafficking are
countless. Sexual harassment in work places comes under sophisticated offence of an
employer are also usual circumstance for a working woman. Unsettled land disputes among
the relatives, land partition disputes, legal heir and succession problems are very common in
villages. Even the number of brides is not rare who are compelled to stay parent’s home
without any maintenance, while husband is practicing bigamy.
</p>
 <p>
For a common man legal literacy seems to be utmost necessity to eliminate the misconception
over the legal system. Some of the reasons discussed below on the need of literacy about
legal system in India –
</p>
<p>
i. Legal aid measures: Cost of the litigation stands as a barrier to access to justice for
common people. Awareness is necessary at this point to let them know that every judiciary
provides free legal assistance to those who cannot afford to access to court. In case of free
legal aid, the court appoints advocate for the sufferer to appear in the and for this they need
not to bear any cost.
</p>
<p>
ii. To retrieve faith over the shrine of justice: Amendment of laws with harsh
punishment for deadly offences, constitution of Fast-track courts for early delivery of justice,
frequent commencement of Lok adalats for reducing the burden of the courts in pending
cases, etc., are the initiatives taken to regain the faith over justice delivery system. Awareness
is necessary to eradicate the prevailed concept of ‘justice delays, justice denies’ from the
mind of the people.
</p>
<p>
iii. Convince people to register cases: Legal literacy is also essential to make people
understand that what remedies are available to them against their sufferance. It will encourage 
people to register cases and help to set examples for the offenders so as to deter
them to repeat crimes.
</p>
<p>
iv. Change of attitude: It is very essential to change thought-process of the society
towards the victims. In India, social humiliation, apathy, indignation towards a victim is a
common social practice. Our society blames the victim first, for which often a victim
hesitates to go to court. Awareness is absolutely obligatory to alter this social attitude.
</p>
<p>
v. Avail fundamental rights: Educate people as to their basic fundamental rights as
well as remedies available for infringement of those rights extended by the Constitution of
India
</p>
<p>
vi. Awareness to the under-privileges: Legal literacy amongst the under-privileges is
very essential to inform about the special legal assistance provided under the Legal Service
Authority Act for the Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribes community2.
