<h2>ABOUT LEGAL LITERACY.</h2>
<P>
In India, every single day thousands of people suffer from various kinds of violations and
they are not aware that they will be remedied under law. As a result, half dozen of the such
incidences are buried under ignorance.
</P>
<P>
Legal knowledge is very essential for socio-economic growth of a country and for political
participation in a democracy. It seems that there are good number of laws comprising every
sector namely, person to property in India, but all such commandments go in vein because of
the prevailing ignorance amongst the illiterate and disinclination attitude of the literate
masses. Under the constitutional mandate of Article 39-A, i.e., free legal aid and social
justice to the people, the government of India has endeavoured manifold schemes with the
novel intention of social welfare.
</P>
<P>
In India, the journey of legal literacy has got the momentum with the enactment of the Legal
Service Authority Act, 1987. Another golden chapter of this journey is the adoption of the
National Legal Literacy Mission in 1995 inspired by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) which hosted the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the poor. In
the same year National Legal Service Authority (NALSA) was established under the Legal
Service Authority Act, 1987 with prime object to provide free legal service to the weaker
sections of the society4 and also to organise Lok Adalats for amicable settlement of disputes.
However, NALSA further directed the State judiciary and District judiciaries to constitute
Legal Service Authority under its banner to hold seminars, workshop, awareness camps or
programmes on legal subjects from time to time. Under the mandate of the Legal Service
Authority Act, every District Legal Service Authority appoints para-legal volunteers (PLV)
among the students pursuing Law Graduation. With the help of these PLVs, the Legal Service
Authorities under different courts has taken up several awareness programme in the society
as well as remote villages.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Bar Council of India instructed to constitute in every legal education centre
one Clinical Legal Aid Centre to actively perform legal aid at the institutional level and to
involve law students to abundant themselves with practical knowledge of legal education and
also to realise the real state of legal awareness under which the common people are going
through.
</P>
<P>
We can name several programmes of the government as well as non-governmental
organisations on legal literacy mission, but a handful of people gets benefitted under it, while
majority are still unfamiliar of the same.
</P>
<P>
There is a need of huge number of legal literacy programme in India at present time because
law is still under the province of those who are qualified on it. Although law is enacted for
the public welfare mainly, practically it is far away from the pubic dominion. From the
history we can derived that legal awareness is not new phenomenon for Indians, but with the
passage of time, it takes new twist and turns with more modern and modified techniques. In
fact, many of the ongoing techniques of legal awareness programmes are not able meet with
expected result. Hence, it’s time to think some alternative practices with more effort to be
adhered to compared to the present methods. 
</P>
<P>
Firstly, day long legal awareness programmes are simply not enough to literate people, it
must be done door to door awareness to ensure that each and every individual is educated.
Although, such process will be time consuming, but legal awareness process is itself a
continuing process.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, “Access to justice for all” is the slogan of NALSA, it is duty of the judiciary to
take justice to the threshold of each individual. It must be ensuring that awareness
programmes are held on vernacular language of the locality for the common people.
Moreover, Legal Service Authority of every court with the help of PLV’s or members of the
Clinical Legal Aid Centre of the Law Institutes should act more on street play, because
visualisation of the situation helps more than dictation
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, legal aid is the primordial right of every citizen as enshrined in the Preamble of the
Constitution of India, i.e., Justice – social, economic and political. Legal literacy programmes
should be organised in order to spread the massage of the right to legal aid to each and every
phase of the society including the undertrials. It is equally important to aware the undertrials
as well as the prisoners that they can also avail right to access to justice through legal aid. In
addition, jail authority may also take initiative to educate the prisoners or undertrials with
basic legal knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, it is pertinent to mention that awareness as to the new enactments or law
amendments and constitution of Fast-track court is not sufficient; furthermore, it must ensure
that cases are under the jurisdiction of appropriate court in order to speedy delivery of justice.
Fifthly, another way to grow legal literacy is to introduce law at the primary level of
education. It will be more fruitful if basic legal provisions are taught at the elementary level
of education. It helps to the children to understand about the law and can recognise various
acts as offences, e.g., child abuses, etc. Moreover, Law institution can offer online as well as
offline diploma courses on basic law education for other people because law is such a subject
which is essential from birth to death of every human being.
</P>
<P>
Sixthly and most importantly, special awareness programme exclusively for women and
children draws supreme significance in legal literacy programme.
Last but not least, the broadcast media including television, electronic media, social media,
etc., and print media as well can be a significant platform for legal literacy among the people.
In present time quite a large number of people fond of these media platform, so, awareness
can be effective through this way.
</P>
<P>
Our duty does not end in just criticising the government and judiciary for their inability to
attain the desired goal; in fact, NGO’s, civil society, law graduates are equally liable to
impart legal awareness as much as possible at their ends. Time is growing fast with
technology, similarly society has to change its prevailing concept – ‘justice is confined to the
wealthy only’. Right to free legal aid to all under the constitutional mandate of Art. 39-A and
the Legal Service Authority Act, 1987 is only perception to be kept in mind of every social
man. The prospects of welfarism will be nipped in the bud if legal knowledge is restricted to a
handful of people. Literacy must start from the root of the earth, that is to say, from the
survivor of misery. The essence of our Preamble – “assuring dignity of the individual and
integrity of the nation” can be truly established only when we assure the legal empowerment
of the society, where voices raised against violations, exploitation, intolerance, deprivation
and discrimination; at the same time, stands in equal shoulder with sufferer, victims and
wounded.
